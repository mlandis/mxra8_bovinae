# Supplementary files for Kim et al. (2019)

Files for:

* Kim et al. (2019) "An evolutionarily ancient sequence insertion in the Mxra8 receptor confers resistance to alphavirus infection"

This repository contains three subdirectories:

* `mxra8_gene_tree` contains the RevBayes scripts and data used to estimate the Mxra8 gene tree topology in Extended Data Figure 12d
* `mxra8_insert_dnds` contains the PAML control files and data used to estimate Mxra8 dN/dS ratios for different panels of sites and under different evolutionary histories
* `alphavirus_dating` contains the RevBayes script and data used to estimate the lower bound on divergence times for crown alphaviruses
